# Awesome-Weakly Supervised Facial Behavior Analysis

A curated list of weakly supervised learning methods for facial behavior analysis in both classification and regression tasks based on our survey paper "Weakly Supervised Learning for Facial Behavior Analysis: A Review". In addition, this repository includes basic datasets widely used in the framework of weakly supervised learning for facial behavior analysis.
